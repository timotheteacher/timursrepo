 git status             command to check the status of our files, if they are added or not.

    2. STAGING -   AFTER WHEN WE RUN COMMAND "GIT ADD ."  - NOW FILES ARE STAGED 
    3 COMMIT - COMMITED (SAVED FILES)

    2. MODIFIED 
    3. STAGED

1. COMMIT ID  (COMMIT SHA/HASH)2
2. (HEAD -> master or main) -  it means your branch taht you work on, and last commit. 
3. author - who made the commit
4. date - when the commit was made
5. commit message - what the commit is about
